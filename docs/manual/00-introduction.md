title: Introduction to Anzen programming
permalink: /manual/
---

Anzen is a programming language that aims at bridging the gap between
modern programming and software verification.
It is primarily inspired by
[Swift](https://swift.org),
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) and
[Python](https://www.python.org).
But it also burrows ideas and concepts from many other languages that would be too long to list.

This manual provides a complete reference to the Anzen language its standard library.
Anzen is designed with *progressive disclosure* in mind,
so that programmers do not have to worry about features they don't use,
until they actually need them.
This manual is designed under the same principle,
meaning that a beginner can read it from start to end with no prior knowledge,
and get introduced to all notions in a consistent order.
