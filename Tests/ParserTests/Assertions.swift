/// This function is inspired by the assertion mechanism proposed in JUnit, which proposes to write
/// assertions with the following syntax:
///
///     assertThat(subject, statement)
///
/// The advantage of this approach over the more classic `XCTAssert` family of functions is that
/// using the above arguably yields more readable statements.
///
/// `subject` can be any Swift value, and `statement` any predicate on `subject`. For instance, the
/// following assertion holds.
///
///     assertThat(3) { $0 > 1 }
///
/// For the sake of legibility, an overloaded version of `assertThat` accepts a special `Assertion`
/// object in place of the predicate, which can act as a functor.
