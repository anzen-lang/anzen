// Test overloaded calls to monomorphic functions.
//
// This test declares two monomorphic functions with a different signatures, which overload the
// same symbol. Two properties are then initialized by using this overload with arguments of
// different type. The type inference should type `a` with `Int`, and `b` with `Bool`, after having
// properly dispatched `mono` using the type of their arguments.
