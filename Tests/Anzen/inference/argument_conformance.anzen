// Tests argument conformance in function calls.
//
// This test declares a single polymorphic function that accepts two arguments of type `Anything`.
// The function is called to initialize a property, with two arguments of type `Int` and `Bool`
// respectively, which obviously conform to `Anything`.

fun mono(x: Anything, y: Anything) -> Anything {
  return <- x
}

// This property should be typed as `Anything`.
let a <- mono(x <- 0, y <- true)
