// Test argument conformance in function call.
//
// This test declares a single polymorphic function that accepts two arguments of type `Anything`.
// The function is called to initialize a property, with two arguments of type `Int` and `Bool`
// respectively. Type inference should accept this program and type the property with `Anything`.
