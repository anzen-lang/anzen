// Tests codomain inference in a polymorphic functions.
//
// This test declares a single polymorphic function that accepts two arguments of generic type `T`
// and `U` respectively. It is called with different combinations of arguments.

fun poly<T, U>(x: T, y: U) -> T {
  return <- x
}

// This property should by typed as `Int`.
let a <- poly(x <- 0, y <- true)

// This property should by typed as `Bool`.
let b <- poly(x <- true, y <- 0)
