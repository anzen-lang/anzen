// Test linear argument inference in a polymorphic function.
//
// This test declares a single polymorphic function that accepts two arguments of generic type `T`
// and `U` respectively. The function is called to initialize two properties with various
// combinations of arguments. Type inference should properly infer the type of each property.

fun poly<T, U>(x: T, y: U) -> T

// The type of `a` should be `Int`, as `x` has type `Int`.
let a = poly(x = 0, y = true)

// The type of `b` should be `Bool`, as`x`has type `Bool`.
let b = poly(x = true, y = 0)
